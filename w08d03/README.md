# W08D03 - Unit & Integration Testing

### To Do
- [x] Tools for testing React
- [x] Add Features/Tests to our App

- [x] Mocking AJAX Requests and Functions

### Types of Testing
* Static -> linter
* Manual -> the dev runs the code
* Unit -> testing the smallest pieces of our code (functions)
* Integration -> test pieces working together
* End-to-end -> test the app like a user
* Regression -> tests that make sure a previous bug/error doesn't come back
* Smoke 

### Tools for Testing React
* Jest => command line test runner (similar to Mocha)
